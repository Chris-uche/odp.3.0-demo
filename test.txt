This is my trial of how to make use of Git commands. 
I believe 3years from today when i open this file again. 
I will be astonished on my level of improvement and and i also believe i will be a professional software developer working on international projects where github will be very vital tool in shipping new features  and i am going to be a lead on it.

just one step at a time and we keep making progress each day.
